# codeigniter_webapp_example
This is an example of a site made with php and codeigniter. It counts with a backend, database connection and usage, session vars for login and logout and a frontend where you see the data setted in the backend. The frontend ItÂ´s currently incomplete. I will update it as soon as I can. Fell free to see it and download it create your own backend/rontend site.
